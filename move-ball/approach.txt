1) variable for ball, ball steps and ball size.
2) viewport height and width
3) random x and y (VP-ballSize)
4) set ball position

----
5) function for move-ball
	I)  set x / y i.e (x/y)+direction*steps.
		parameteres(directionX,directionY)
		--> we need somethings to know, which axis we have to move and that too forward or backward.
		--> so we will use (1 for forward and -1 for backward)
		--> and at one point ball will move either horizontally or vertically so either pf them
			will always be zero.  Eg. move upwards(x:0,y:-1)
			now when we multiply -1 to steps we will have -3 that when added with current position it will reduce the pixel 
			with 30units.
	II) check if goes beyond veiwport.
	III) set position according to x/y.
