HTML:

1) main container div.
2) usually we would have used another div for toggle container but here we will used
   label with the class as toggle and inside that we will have input checkbox, and slider id in a span.
   --> the reason for not taking a div again is that, div will not giv as much flexibility aswe want in 
       this case because it is a toggle button so , using label and then checkbox will save us from
       writing extra code for toggle and we will have a lot more flexibility.

3) after label we can have text to click on toggle button.


CSS:

1) container: make it flex and cloumn wise in center. so that toggle button and text come one below another.
2) toggle: we have to make its position relative idk. there should not be any other element in that line(use display property)
           as it is the container for toggle button ,we will set height and width also.

3) we also want a toggle button, not a checkbox so we will hide checkbox

4) now we will use slider class to create a capsule that will serve as our sliding area.its position will be absolute.
    imp:::::: also use top, left, right,bottom.

5) The .slider:before selector in your CSS code is using the 
   ::before pseudo-element to create an additional visual element before the .
   slider element. Pseudo-elements are virtual elements that you can use to style a specific part of an 
   HTML element without adding extra markup(code) to your HTML structure.
   --> we will create a sphere shape that will be inside the slider capsule(.slider:before{}) and position should be absolute.

6) now we have to write code so that whenever slider-shape(sphere) is clicked the color of slider should change-
7) now we have to write code so that whenever slider-shape(sphere) is clicked the shape should move like a toggle button.
