# JavaScript Learning Projects

Welcome to the JavaScript Learning Projects repository! 
This repository contains a collection of JavaScript programsthat are helping me to learn JavaScript in a practical and hands-on way. 
Each program focuses on specific concepts and features of JavaScript while providing a fun and interactive learning experience.

## Programs

### 1. Catch Me Program
A simple web page featuring a ball-shaped element at the center. As you hover over the ball, it moves randomly within the viewport. 
This example demonstrates mouse event handling and manipulating element positions dynamically.


## Usage
Each program is contained in its own directory, complete with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 
You can explore and interact with each project individually by opening the HTML files in a web browser. 
Feel free to examine the code to understand how each program is implemented and experiment with modifications.
