# JavaScript Learning Projects

Welcome to the JavaScript Learning Projects repository! 
This repository contains a collection of JavaScript programsthat are helping me to learn JavaScript in a practical and hands-on way. 
Each program focuses on specific concepts and features of JavaScript while providing a fun and interactive learning experience.

## Programs

### 1. move-ball
A simple web page featuring a ball-shaped element at the center. This program has the most basic function: to move an element on the viewport. In this case, a ball that should stay within the viewport's height and width.

### 2. Counter-2
This program prompts the user to input a number between 1 and 99999. After entering the number, a countdown timer starts, displaying the remaining time in seconds. This exercise covers input validation, interval-based operations, and updating the DOM.

### 3. Change-color-shape
This program demonstrates how to change the styling properties of an element, such as color and shape, using JavaScript. Here, we have used the built-in random function of JavaScript to generate random colors.

## Usage
Each program is contained in its own directory, complete with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 
You can explore and interact with each project individually by opening the HTML files in a web browser. 
Feel free to examine the code to understand how each program is implemented and experiment with modifications.
