## Variables::
    1) an array of objects for storing the task at one place.
    2) an input variable for for getting input from user , we have input text box, so we'll use that element.
    3) a task-counter Variables
    4) a variable for list of task, we have a list , so we'll use that only. 

## Program::

   ** After every operation like adding, deleteing , and marking we have to show notification and render the list.
    1) first we will add an event listener on input, that will be triggered by keypress, it will get us our task input text.
        --> that event will have a function:
            --> this function will get the input from the eventListener and first it will check if pressed key is 'Enter' or not 
                if it is 'Enter' that means user is done writing and now wants to save the task. so it will have a variable and 
                it will store the the text received on input box using 'event.target.value'.
                --> if received input is empty then it will showNotification() that its empty and return.
                --> otherwise it will create an object:
                    OBJECT: it will have the text, an id: Date.now().toString() and a property Done as false.
                --> after create object we will set the input to empty again, and call the addTask function with object as argument.
    2) addTask function::
        --> it will take an object(task) as input and add that to the array.            

    3) deleteTask function::
        --> logic is simple we take a task id(that has to be deleted) as argument, create an array using filter() method, that will 
            create a new array that will include all arrays elements except the task with given id, and then we can simly replace(copy) 
            our array with this new Array. 
    4)markTaskComplete function::
        -->aim is to mark a given task as done or complete, first we will get our desired task
           from the tasks array using filter, and store it in array, and from that array extract the variable and using dot operator mark it
           as done,i.e "currTask.Done = !currTask.Done;"

    5) showNotification function ::
        --> simply takes a text as input and alerts the text.

    6)handleTaskInput::
        --> this function will only be called on **keypress eventListener** attached to input variable (*2*),and it is responsible for taking 
            inputs(text/task) from user then creating an object 'task' with that text, an id and task status 
            as properties,and then it passes the task object to addTask() function.
    7)handleClickEvents::
        --> this function will be called on **click event listner** attached to whole document so that we dont have to write separate eventListener
            for 'markTaskComplete' then for 'deleteTask'.
            --> it will call above two functions with appropriate arguments.


=>>>Event Listeners:
    1) addTaskInput.addEventListener('keypress', handleTaskInput);
    2) document.addEventListener('click', handleClickEvents)

--> we can wrap both this eventListener in one function and then call that function simply.
        function initializeToDo() {
    // event that will be triggred when user starts typing.
    addTaskInput.addEventListener('keypress', handleTaskInput);

    // event listener on whole document, so that we can target desired elements without writing multiple event listener
    document.addEventListener('click', handleClickEvents)
}
